Advanced extensions

1. Assignment 1: Graph search
Of the 4 possible advanced extension points, one additional point for this assignment can be earned by implementing a navigation algorithm using a probabilistic roadmap ("PRM"). This roadmap algorithm implementation must be contained within the file "search_canvas.html" under the "project_pathplan" directory.

2. Assignment 5: Inverse Kinematics
Of the 4 possible advanced extension points, one additional point for this assignment can be earned by reaching to 100 targets in a random trial within 60 seconds. A video of this execution must be provided to demonstrate this achievement. This video file should be in the repository root directory with the name "IK100in60" and appropriate file extension.

3. Assignment 6: motion planning
Of the 4 possible advanced extension points, one additional point for this assignment can be earned by adding the capability of motion planning to an arbitrary robot configuration goal.
